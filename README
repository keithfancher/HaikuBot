HAIKUBOT
========

An artful automaton with a penchant for poetry.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* ruby 1.8
* an appreciation for the developing talents of a sensitive young poet-bot


USAGE
-----
HaikuBot is shy and performs only when prompted from the command line:

    $ ./haikubot.rb
    chary self-concept
    ladanum hazelnut strut
    postanesthetic

Read each of his poems thoughtfully. When appropriate, stroke your chin, cluck
your tongue, and look contemplative. You might also light a cigarette, but then
get so swept up in the startling fury of HaikuBot's imagery that you forget to
smoke it.
