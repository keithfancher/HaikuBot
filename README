HAIKUBOT
========

An artful automaton with a penchant for poetry.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* Ruby 1.8.x
* Sinatra (if you use the web interface)
* An appreciation for the developing talents of a sensitive young poet-bot


USAGE
-----
HaikuBot is shy and performs only when prompted from the command line:

    $ ./haikubot.rb
    chary self-concept
    ladanum hazelnut strut
    postanesthetic

Read each of his poems thoughtfully. When appropriate, stroke your chin, cluck
your tongue, and look contemplative. You might also light a cigarette, but then
get so swept up in the startling fury of HaikuBot's imagery that you forget to
smoke it.


WEB INTERFACE
-------------
There's also a web interface! It's still a work-in-progress, but if you have
Sinatra installed you can play with it:

    $ ./haikubot_web.rb

Then navigate to localhost:4567 in your browser and be AMAZED. Note: you can
also use the web interface to get plaintext haiku with curl:

    $ curl localhost:4567/raw/
    fetishist fungal
    huntress undancing nutmeat
    smallclothes otter shrew
